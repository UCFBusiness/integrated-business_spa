                                            <p>Beginning in 2015, UCF-CBA raised the standards for all of the degree programs in the college, while providing an educational experience that better reflects the demands of the marketplace. Our objective is to help our students "get to the one" - become the person that gets the job...starts a new business...makes a contribution...gives back...wins the contract.</p>
                                                <p>In the end, business is all about "getting to the one" and our curriculum, programs, and events are all designed to equip our students to achieve the objective.</p>
                                                <p>Today, students must prepare for a more diversified economy that offers shorter- term employment prospects and values customization, connectivity and speed. Companies need people who can innovate by connecting the dots, communicate effectively with diverse groups of people and assume different roles as the firm responds to a turbulent marketplace.</p>
                                                <p>This demand require employees who understand the entire enterprise, see opportunities in emerging trends, and can pull together diverse resources to create value. As such, business school faculty must work in new ways to provide the kind of education that produces such "integrators" by changing the culture, structure, and substance of the business school experience.</p>
                                                <p>The UCF College of Business Administration is creating the right environment, employing the best faculty, and facilitating innovative programs to give students a competitive advantage in the world of business now and in the future. The Integrated Business Major has been developed in partnership with local business leaders and alumni who are searching for people that demonstrate the following skills and traits.</p>

                                                    <li>Able to collect, analyze and act on real time data in ways that create competitive advantage.</li>
                                                    <li>Comfortable working outside of their comfort zone and are willing to take smart risks.</li>
                                                    <li>Effective and innovative problem solvers who know how to take lessons learned in one environment and successfully apply them in a different context.</li>
                                                </ul>
                                                <p>These qualities transcend "majors" and will be a competitive edge for our students as they compete for their jobs, build varied careers and aspire to leadership.</p>
                                                <p>The University of Central Florida College of Business Administration (<strong>UCF CBA</strong>) is pioneering the new business school experience.  Faculty, alums, prospective employers and friends of the college all contributed to a new program and structure that will better equip graduates to lead in the marketplace - today and in the future.  In addition, our programs have all raised the bar on expectations, accountability and performance of our faculty and students, creating a more competitive and challenging educational experience.</p>
                                                <p>The <strong>UCF CBA</strong> delivers on its vision and mission through its four unique strengths and qualities. Experience, culture, leadership and place define and determine the success of our students, stakeholders, and community.</p>
                                                <p>All of these are closely linked to the <strong>UCF CBA</strong>. In addition, UCF is the second largest university in the United States, providing an unparalleled opportunity to work with the most diverse and dynamic student body.</p>

                                        <h4>Advantages of the Integrated Business Degree</h4>
                                        <p>The Integrated Business (IB) degree is designed to provide students with a diverse tool set and integrative skills so that they can successfully navigate the volatile and challenging marketplace facing graduates.</p>
                                        <img src="images/students-notebook.jpg" alt="..." class="responsive" width="100%"><p></p>
                                        <p>Today's student may go on to a career that comprises as many as six to nine jobs. They will work in several organizations and be required to manage a wide variety of programs across the business enterprise. Approximately 40% of employees in Central Florida work for companies with less than 500 employees. Additionally, most job growth nationwide is in small and medium size enterprises. If a graduate stays in the Central Florida area, it is very likely that they will work in small and mid-sized companies where the skills of a "business generalist" or an "integrator" will be necessary and highly valued.</p>
                                        <p>To this end, the IB degree will provide a more robust and varied educational experience than most specialty degree programs.</p>

                                    <div class="col-sm-7">
                                        <h4>Students transferring into the IB degree from a state college</h4>
                                        <p>It is expected that all incoming transfer students, regardless of intended business major, will upon admission to the university have successfully completed the General Education Program and the Business Common Program prerequisites.  Transfer students will attend an orientation session that will provide information regarding university and college policy, IB degree requirements, and college culture.</p>
                                        <p>It is a minimum of 120 hours to earn an IB degree.</p>
                                        <p>Students entering College of Business Administration (CBA) with an AA degree from a Florida state college and having satisfactorily completed the business common program prerequisites will be required to complete a minimum of an additional 60 upper-level hours within CBA to earn an IB degree.  These requirements are the same for all BSBA degrees offered by CBA.</p>
                                        <p>Students starting UCF as freshmen, and successfully completing a minimum of 15 hours per term (fall and spring), should expect to complete the IB degree in four years.  Transfer students, from a Florida state college who come to UCF with satisfactory completion of the business common program prerequisites, who successfully complete a minimum of 15 hours per term (fall and spring), should expect to complete the IB degree after two years of attendance at UCF.</p>
                                        <p>Time to degree completion is the same for all BSBA degrees offered by CBA.</p>
                                        <p>Are there opportunities for minors?</p>
                                        <p>A minor is not required within the IB degree. Students however may choose to add a minor, assuming that the admission requirements for the minor are met.  The addition of a minor will increase the hours to degree completion and may also extend time to degree completion.  Students considering the addition of a minor should educate themselves on the implications this action may have regarding the excess hours charge as well as the potential impact on financial aid and/or scholarships.</p>

                                        <p>More than 80% of the economy is comprised of what we consider to be "small" or "medium" sized companies. This sector continues to be the backbone of the marketplace and has a strong foothold in the metro-Orlando area. Employers are increasingly looking for candidates that bring a broader skill set to the table and can easily move and adapt to new roles in the organization. "The Generalist" is finding more opportunities and there are a number of articles and research that indicates that the marketplace will continue to demand more people with these skills.</p>
                                        <p>About 40% of employees in Central Florida work for companies with less than 500 employees. Add in the fact that most job growth (and loss) nationwide (if not worldwide) is in small and medium size enterprises (SME). It is likely that many UCF grads will be working for companies with less than 500 employees.</p>

                                        <p>The IB degree is intended to develop a strong business "generalist" who has the ability and capacity to enter the workforce with a broad understanding of business and strong financial, analytic and communication skills.  As such, they will be an attractive candidate for entry-level roles in project management, operational management, and sales management.</p>

                                        <p>In the fall of 2014 the college implemented a series of Professional Development classes.  This curriculum is a series of four one-hour classes that are required for all business majors and is designed to assist students in securing employment in their desired field prior to graduation.</p>
                                        <p>In the Professional Development classes, students begin by completing assessment tools that help align their career and major interest.  Students then progress to researching a target career, target company(ies), preparing their resume, etc… to participating in mock interviews, attending networking events, and ultimately implementing their career plan.  These courses are action oriented and require students to be engaged with their classmates, faculty and staff, as well as business and community leaders.</p>
                                        <p>A brief course description for each of the four classes in the Professional Development series is below:</p>
